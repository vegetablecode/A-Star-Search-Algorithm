 # A* Search Algorithm

## What is it?
This is an implementation of A* Search Algorithm. Basically, it was created to solve the chess problem, but there are more options to set and see how it works.

### Chess Problem
![Chess Problem](/screenshots/1.png)
The aim of this app is to find the shortest path from the starting point (knight) to the ending point (king). What's more, you can't move into a field with the tower or any field in the same row or column. You are the knight, so you are only allowed to make following moves:
- 1 right, 2 up
- 2 right, 1 up
- 2 right, 1 down
- 1 right, 2 down
- 1 left, 2 down
- 2 left, 1 down
- 2 left, 1 up
- 1 left, 2 up

There's the solution of this problem:

### Legend
- pink dot - knight
- orange dot - king
- black dot - tower
- grey fields - obstacles

protip: to turn on random obstacles, just type in console: "obstacles = true"
